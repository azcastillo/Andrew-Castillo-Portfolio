## Project 1: CoverMyMeds Erdos Bootcamp Prior Authorization Predictor: Project Overview 
* Two part project in which I created two models to make predictions based on prior authorization information. 

* Part 1 of the project consisted of creating a model predicting whether a prior authorization would be needed based upon pharmacy claims data. This portion of the prject also consisted of exploratory data analysis in which the following questions were answered: 

  * Which insurance companies had the most approved pharmacy claims? 
  * Which drug was approved the most (numerically)? Which rejection code seemed to appear the most with each drug? 
  * What about a scaled version of this? Relatively, how much did each code appear for each drug?

* Part 2 of the project consisted of creating a model predicting whether a prior authorization is likely to be approved. This model was based on data contained on the PA such as correct diagnosis, has already tried and failed a generic drug alternative, has health-related reasons not to take certain medications (contraindications), and claims data. Moreover, this portion consisted of exploratory data analysis in which the following questions were answered (based only on the prior authorization data): 

  * What is the relationship between the correct diagnosis, tried and failed, and contraindication and the prior authorization being approved? 
  * Of the people who have or have not tried and failed a generic alternative, how many of them had contraindications or a correct diagnosis?
